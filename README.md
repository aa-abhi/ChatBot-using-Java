# ChatBot-using-Java


Building a Chatbot using Java- This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to build a simple chatbot using Java. The chatbot will be able to respond to user messages with predefined answers based on matching user input with patterns in a JSON file. 

Prerequisites:
- Java SE Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) installed (e.g. Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA)
- Basic understanding of Java programming language

Steps:

1. Create a new Java project in your IDE or text editor. 
2. Download the JSON Java library and add it to your project dependencies. You can download the library from this link: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json/20210307
3. Create a new class called `Chatbot.java` and implement the following methods:
  - `public Chatbot(String intentsPath)` - constructor that initializes the chatbot with a JSON file containing the predefined responses and patterns.
  - `public String getResponse(String message)` - method that takes a user message as input and returns a response from the chatbot based on the matching patterns and responses in the JSON file.
4. Create a new class called `ChatInterface.java` and implement the following methods:
  - `public ChatInterface(Chatbot chatbot)` - constructor that initializes the chat interface with a chatbot instance.
  - `public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)` - method that handles user input and updates the chat interface with the user's message and chatbot's response.
  - `public static void main(String[] args)` - method that creates a chatbot instance and initializes the chat interface with the chatbot.
5. Create a JSON file called `intents.json` that contains predefined responses and patterns for the chatbot. The file should have the following format:

```json
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greeting",
      "patterns": ["Hi", "Hello", "Hey", "Howdy"],
      "responses": ["Hello!", "Hi there!", "Greetings!"]
    },
    {
      "tag": "goodbye",
      "patterns": ["Bye", "Goodbye", "See you later"],
      "responses": ["Goodbye!", "Take care!", "See you later!"]
    }
  ]
}
```

6. Run the `ChatInterface.java` file and start chatting with your chatbot!

Improvements:
- Add more patterns and responses to the `intents.json` file to improve the chatbot's accuracy.
- Use a machine learning framework to create a more sophisticated chatbot that can learn from user interactions.
- Implement a user interface that is more interactive and visually appealing.
